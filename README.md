### Cloning Amazon.com: A Web Development Project

Project Overview

This repository contains my HTML and CSS project where I cloned the Amazon.com homepage. The primary focus was on replicating the visual design and layout using HTML for structure and CSS for styling, without incorporating functionality.

**Technologies Used**

- **HTML:** Structured the webpage elements.
- **CSS:** Styled and positioned elements to closely match Amazon.comâ€™s design.

**Key Features**

- **Navigation Bar:** Styled to reflect the Amazon.com aesthetic.
- **Responsive Search Bar:** Layout designed with a dropdown and search icon for visual appeal.
- **Product Showcase Section:** Responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes, showcasing products visually.
- **Footer:** Comprehensive footer styled with links and essential information.

**Usage**

This project serves as a demonstration of HTML and CSS capabilities. Feel free to explore the code and adapt the styles for your own projects.

**Feedback**

I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improving the styling and design aspects of this clone. Contributions and ideas are appreciated.
